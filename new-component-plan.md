** Back-end Components **

# Express Rate Limit:

Express-rate-limit is a basic rate-limiting middleware for Express. 

It is used to control and limit repeated requests to APIs and improve system stability. 
In my project, I will analyze the most used and sensitive endpoints, 
such as the borrow and other routes, and set different rate limits to 
manage excessive API calls effectively. 

# Resources

I will refer to the official npm documentation and related 
Express resources to understand how the middleware works, 
including its configuration options like request limits and custom error messages.


## Deployment (Vercel):
Vercel is a cloud platform used to deploy web applications directly from GitHub. 
It provides continuous deployment. 
For my project, 
I will connect my GitHub repository to Vercel, and it will
automatically detect my framework and deploy the 
Library Management System API when i will push.
